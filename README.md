# MY-MAP
My map is a web application ,it consists of input fields for the two points (to and from) and a map . 
When we insert (autocomplete) the origin and the destination place (from , to),a polyline should be drawn on the map with the distance ,time of the travel 
plus the instructions that will allow you to go from one point to another . 
Clicking to two or more points on the map in sequence should also set them as to and from coordinates and it give you the name of the place plus distance and other details .
